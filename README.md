## Project Summary
The Memory Lane application is a social media application because users can create and share posts (hereon referred to as "time capsules") in the form of images, text, or both. Users share these time capsules with other users (i.e. friends on the app). The goal of the project was to create a platform where people could reminisce about their past experiences and connect with others who have similar memories.

The development process for the Memory Lane App began with extensive brainstorming and planning. The team held a brainstorming session to identify the target audience, analysed competitors to identify best practices, and created user personas to guide the development process.

Once the brainstorming phase was completed, the team moved on to the design phase. We created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the application's user interface and user experience. Our UI designersâ€™ feedback was collected and used to refine the design.

After the design phase, development began. The team used agile development methodology to deliver the application in iterations. The application was built using Angular and Ionic for the front-end and NestJS, CQRS and firebase for the back-end. The team also used Firebase for authentication, cloud storage, and hosting.

Throughout the development process, the team conducted rigorous testing to ensure the application's functionality and performance. We used automated testing tools, specifically the Github Actions to test the front-end, and unit testing tools, specifically the Jest, to test the back-end.

The Memory Lane App focuses on a mobile viewpoint. The app includes features such as creating and sharing memories, discovering memories from friends and family, connecting with others, and liking, commenting, and sharing memories. The app also prioritizes user privacy by allowing users to control the privacy of their memories.

Overall, the development process for the Memory Lane App was successful. The team delivered a high-quality application that met the project's goals and objectives.
